/**
 * The `architecture-review` capability: sweep the codebase on `main` for the
 * single freshest **deepening opportunity** and propose it as a PRD — the
 * autonomous, GitHub-native analogue of CVM's interactive
 * `/improve-codebase-architecture`.
 *
 * Invoked by `.github/workflows/agent-architecture-review.yml` on a weekday cron
 * and via `workflow_dispatch` — NOT by a label, so unlike the other capabilities
 * there is no originating issue/PR. It therefore reads its own minimal env (the
 * past proposals to dedupe against, an optional provider label set, `OUTPUT_DIR`)
 * instead of {@link import("../capability-context").loadCapabilityContext},
 * which is issue-shaped.
 *
 * A **two-phase** capability ({@link runWithExtraction}): the produce pass
 * surveys the tree in prose (read-only — it commits nothing), the resumed
 * extraction pass emits the `proposed | skipped` decision. It does NOT drive the
 * interactive `/improve-codebase-architecture` skill (that one is
 * `disable-model-invocation` and needs an HTML report + a human to grill through
 * candidates); the survey is described directly in the prompt using the
 * `/codebase-design` deep-module vocabulary.
 *
 * Per invariant H the runner only writes output files: `architecture_status.txt`
 * (`proposed`/`skipped`) and `architecture_summary.txt` (the `oneLineSummary` when
 * proposed, the `reason` when skipped). When `proposed` it also writes
 * `architecture_candidates.txt` (the candidates weighed, one per line, for the
 * Actions summary), `prd_title.txt`, and `prd_body.txt`. The workflow opens the
 * PRD, labels it, and writes the run summary.
