/**
 * The `to-issues-prd` capability: decompose a PRD issue into agent-sized child
 * issues (CVM's `to-issues-prd`, reconciled to Unshelf's seam).
 *
 * Invoked by `.github/workflows/agent-to-issues.yml` when a human applies
 * `agent:to-issues` to a PRD. The agent only *reads* the PRD and *emits* the
 * decomposition — it creates nothing. Because the structured output IS the work
 * (no branch, no commits, no files touched), this uses {@link runWithRetry},
 * matching CVM.
 *
 * Per Unshelf invariant H (and issue #69: "the agent emits only output; the
 * workflow performs the issue creation") this diverges from CVM's runner, which
 * does the `gh issue create` itself: here the slices are rendered and written to
 * `child_issues.json` for the workflow's create + sub-issue-link steps, keeping
 * every `gh` mutation in the workflow. Reads the PRD coordinates through the
 * shared {@link loadPrdPrContext} seam (PRD_NUMBER/PRD_TITLE) — no branch, so no
 * BRANCH env is involved.
