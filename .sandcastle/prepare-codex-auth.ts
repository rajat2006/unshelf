/**
 * Prepare the runner environment so `codex exec` authenticates against the
 * ChatGPT subscription seat (`gpt-5.6-sol`) rather than the metered Platform API.
 * Called by every capability script immediately before `sandcastle.run()`, so the
 * setup is uniform across phases (spec #52 / #64).
 *
 * For the Claude Code default (`providerName !== "codex"`) this is a no-op — its
 * token lives in the env and needs no file materialisation.
 *
 * For Codex it does three things, in the order Codex needs them:
 *
 * 1. Seed `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json` from `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` (mode 0600) — but ONLY
 *    when the file is absent. Codex refreshes the ChatGPT tokens *in place*
 *    during a run, so once an earlier phase (implement) has written the file,
 *    re-seeding it in a later phase (write-pr) would discard the freshly
 *    refreshed credentials and restore the stale seed. `$CODEX_HOME` is stable
 *    across a job's steps, so seed-if-absent keeps the first-phase refresh live
 *    for every later phase (OpenAI CI guidance; see `docs/agents/sandcastle.md`).
 * 2. Ensure `$CODEX_HOME/config.toml` sets {@link CREDENTIALS_STORE_LINE}, so
 *    Codex reads that file rather than the unreachable OS keyring.
 * 3. Strip `OPENAI_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the env — if either is present
 *    Codex bills the metered API and can fail `Quota exceeded` even with a valid
 *    subscription. The workflow does not set them; this is the defensive backstop.
 *
 * Steps 2–3 run every phase (idempotent, per-process); only the seed in step 1
 * is guarded on the file's absence.
 *
 * When it does seed, `CODEX_AUTH_JSON` is validated as JSON and required: a
 * missing/mangled secret on the first phase is a wiring bug that should land the
 * issue in `agent:blocked`, not silently fall through to a broken run.
 *
 * @param providerName the resolved provider (`ctx.agent.name`)
 * @param env the environment to read the secret from and strip keys on; defaults
 *   to `process.env` (the live env `run()` hands to the spawned `codex exec`)
