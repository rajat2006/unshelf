/**
 * The `implement-pr` capability: address the review comments on an open PR.
 *
 * Invoked by `.github/workflows/agent-implement-pr.yml` when a PR gets
 * `agent:implement-pr`. A **two-phase** capability ({@link runWithExtraction}):
 * the produce pass reads the PR's review threads, changes what it safely can,
 * runs the repo's checks, and commits the fixes (reasoning in prose); the resumed
 * extraction pass emits one structured `<output>` block recording what it
 * addressed vs deferred — so the agent never has to both do the work and
 * serialise rigid JSON in one turn, and a malformed block self-corrects via
 * same-session retry (≤3×) before anything is posted.
 *
 * Per invariant H the runner emits ONLY commits + output files: the fix commits
 * land on the branch (the workflow pushes them) and `pr_comment.md` — a
 * Markdown summary of what was addressed/deferred — is written to `OUTPUT_DIR`.
 * The workflow pushes the commits and posts that summary as a PR comment. It
 * does NOT flip the PR's draft/ready state — implement-pr only answers review
 * comments; the ready transition belongs to review.
