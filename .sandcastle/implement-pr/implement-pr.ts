/**
 * The `implement-pr` capability: address the review comments on an open PR.
 *
 * Invoked by `.github/workflows/agent-implement-pr.yml` when a PR gets
 * `agent:implement-pr`. A **two-phase** capability ({@link runWithExtraction}):
 * the produce pass reads the PR's review threads, changes what it safely can,
 * runs the repo's checks, and commits the fixes (reasoning in prose); the resumed
 * extraction pass emits one structured `<output>` block recording what it
 * addressed vs deferred — so the agent never has to both do the work and
 * serialise rigid JSON in one turn, and a malformed block self-corrects via
 * same-session retry (≤3×) before anything is posted.
 *
 * The productive agent publishes fix/recovery commits and proves Product CI, but
 * feedback publication remains workflow-owned. This runner writes the summary,
 * replies, and green head SHA to `OUTPUT_DIR`; the workflow revalidates them
 * before posting. Implement-PR never flips draft/ready state.
