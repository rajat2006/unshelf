 *   conflicts) and a merge commit was made.
 * - `already-current` — `main` was already an ancestor of the branch head, so
 *   the merge was a no-op and no commit was made.
 * - `blocked` — the agent could not safely complete the merge (a conflict needing
 *   a product decision) and aborted, leaving the branch untouched for a human.
 *   Carries a `reason`. The runner turns this into a non-zero exit so the
 *   workflow marks the PR `agent:blocked` — the "ask for a human" lifecycle.

 * self-corrects via same-session retry before the workflow does anything
 * (spec #52 / #67).
 *
 * The agent's claim here is NOT trusted on its own: `update-branch.ts`
 * cross-checks a `merged`/`already-current` claim against the real git state
 * (ancestry, a genuine merge commit, no unresolved paths, no lingering merge
 * state) via {@link import("./verify-branch-update").verifyBranchUpdate} before
 * the workflow pushes. This schema's job is to carry the agent's *intent* — in
 * particular a `blocked` outcome, which git state alone cannot distinguish from
 * an ordinary clean tree.
 *
 * - `summary` — always required; the one-line headline the posted comment leads
 *   with (e.g. "Merged main into the branch, resolving 2 conflicts.").
 * - `reason` — required when (and only meaningful when) `outcome` is `blocked`:
 *   why a human is needed. Surfaced in the `agent:blocked` comment.
 * - `conflicts` — one entry per file that conflicted and was resolved. Non-empty
 *   only makes sense for `merged`; a `blocked` (aborted) or `already-current`
 *   (no-op) run resolved nothing, so both refinements below reject a non-empty
 *   list there and force an honest re-emit.
