/**
 * Parse a unified diff into the set of new-side line numbers each file *adds or
 * changes* — the lines a review finding may legitimately point at.
 *
 * A pure string-in / map-out function (no fs, no git): the review capability
 * feeds it `git diff origin/main...HEAD` and uses the result to check that every
 * finding's `file:line` anchor falls on a line the PR actually touched, so the
 * posted comment can't point a reviewer at an unchanged line the agent imagined
 * (spec #52 / #65 — the pure diff parser behind `review-output` validation).
 *
 * Only `+` (added) lines are recorded: they are the new-side lines present in
 * the working tree at the numbers a reviewer would see. Context lines advance
 * the new-side counter but aren't themselves "changed"; `-` (deleted) lines
 * exist only on the old side and never get a new-side number.
 *
 * @param diff a unified diff (git's default `diff --git` format)
 * @returns file path (repo-relative, `b/` prefix stripped) → set of added
 *   new-side line numbers. Files with no added lines (pure deletions) are
 *   omitted; a deleted file (`+++ /dev/null`) never appears.
