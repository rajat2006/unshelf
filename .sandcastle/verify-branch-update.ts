 * that gives up can still emit a success-shaped block — deterministic
 * postconditions (CVM parity) are what stop an aborted or half-finished merge
 * from being pushed and reported as "Merged main."
 *
 * A `blocked` claim is NOT the concern of this function — the runner routes that
 * to failure with the agent's own `reason` before calling here. If a `blocked`
 * outcome reaches this function it is treated as a verification failure, since a
 * blocked run must never be pushed.
 *
 * Returns `{ ok: true }` when every postcondition holds, or `{ ok: false, reason }`
 * with a human-readable reason the runner writes to `failure_reason.txt` for the
 * `agent:blocked` comment.
