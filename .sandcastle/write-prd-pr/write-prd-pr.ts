/**
 * The `write-prd-pr` capability: author the title and body for the draft PR that
 * delivers a whole PRD.
 *
 * Invoked by `.github/workflows/agent-implement-prd.yml` on the FIRST sub-issue
 * run only (the workflow reuses the same PR across every later run). So the body
 * must describe the PRD as a whole, not the one sub-issue that happened to open
 * it. The agent only reads the PRD and its sub-issues and summarises them — it
 * implements nothing and commits nothing. Because the structured output IS the
 * work, this uses {@link runWithRetry}: a single combined prompt drafts and
 * emits, retrying the same session on a malformed or non-conforming `<output>`.
 *
 * The title/body are written to `outputDir` as flat text files for the
 * workflow's `gh pr create --body-file`, keeping every git/gh mutation in the
 * workflow. Provider and coordinates come from the shared PRD seam.
